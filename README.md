# Hunter Web Apps

This repo serves as a template for any static html sites that we have to create.

This template is only meant to support modern browsers. I freely use modern features such as web components.

`live-server` is used because ES6 modules cannot be executed when running `file:///C:/index.html`.

## Install Steps

1. `git clone <https://github.com/hunterwebapps/static-site-template.git> {new site name}`
2. `rm -rf .git` folder to clear git history
3. `cd` into {new site name} folder
4. Update `meta` tags in `index.html`
5. `npm install`
6. `npm run dev`

## Final Step

Replace the contents of this README with contents relevant to the new site.
